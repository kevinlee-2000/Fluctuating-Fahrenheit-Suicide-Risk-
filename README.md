# Data Science Research on Temperature and Suicide risk

Is there a relationship between temperature trends and number of suicides in New York City? More specifically:

1. Do suicide rates in a given season differ when average temperatures in that season deviate from typical* seasonal temperatures?
2. Do suicide rates differ between men and women in years when there is higher temperature fluctuation?

*Typical refers here to the average seasonal temperature across the years 2008-2014
