    "All of the members of our group are or have been involved with the healthcare industry in some capacity and care deeply about the wellbeing of our fellow citizens. As we see it, suicide constitutes a serious threat to societal and community wellbeing. As such, we are interested in analyzing current data on monthly temperature averages and corresponding monthly suicide rates in the context of a large American city. This would shed light on an issue that has only previously been explored in the United Kingdom and some European countries some number of decades ago (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "While there has been ample research conducted in the United States to assess the effects of climate change on suicide rates (1, 3), we think that a more granular analysis of monthly fluctuations in temperature and the corresponding rates of suicide could offer additional insight into the relationship between these two phenomena. Furthermore, we would like to explore the possibility that abnormally cold or warm temperatures in a given month might correlate with abnormal rates of suicide. \n",

    "The ideal datasets that we would want to answer this question are those that have the specific variables we are looking for, such as historical monthly temperature and suicide rates. These will ideally have at least 1000 observations to be able to have reasonably normalized datasets to extrapolate from. In addition, our ideal dataset would cover the last 10 years (up to 2020) to be able to gain the most accurate data that concerns our current society. These datasets would have been collected by official third parties and made available to the public stored ideally in JSON or CSV format for easy processing."
